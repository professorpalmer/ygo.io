            <h2>Latest Updates</h2>
            <time>Posted on: June 6th, 2024</time>
            <p>This list feels <strong>much better.</strong></p>
            <p>Going second is <strong>much stronger.</strong></p>
            <p>Grind game is <strong>much stronger.</strong></p>
            <p><em>The opening lines have changed slightly for some of the starters. No longer have to blow your Satellite load and start your follow up turn with an empty hand.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Vahram</strong> gives a ton of flexibility while maintaining high threat. Consider swapping out if you find you need the space.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For instance, if you don't want to drop Shuraig to fit Naturia Beast you can sub this card out.</li>
                <li>Mosquito is too good to sub out right now. It wins games solo.</li>
                <li>Naturia Beast is a <strong>must</strong> in this meta, imo. It also wins games solo.</li>
                <li>Ferrijit is amazing for extensions + she's the same size as S:P Little Knight which comes up a decent amount to be honest.</li>
                <li>The rest of the cards I consider legitimately fundamental and cannot be replaced. No joke, I'd replace Zeus before I subbed any of the other unlisted ED monsters out.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Kittytail / Naturia Beast / Peropero</strong> are all incredible cards in the current meta. Nat beast is an instant win vs Horus, Tearlaments, Despia, Purrely, etc. It's a very strong card vs Rescue Ace and Snake Eye as well. Notice how those are all the best decks? Run it!!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I subbed out Kittytail for the time being because I'm afraid of losing Nat beast access by using the KT > Peropero to GY effect. Instead, I dropped KT and the Deep Sea Divas and added more tech cards. Kittytail still has an incredible effect. It might be worth running her regardless so that if you cannot Nat Beast turn 1, you can still preserve other options with the same cards in the deck.</li>
                <li>Naturia Beast is only really viable if you have Rcat or Peropero in hand. Still, if Rcat is your <strong>only</strong> option, then you don't want a naked Naturia Beast on board. It's basically GG at that point. <strong>ONLY</strong> naked Nat Beast if you have a Melffy to summon from hand to provide additional pressure / support the fragile Beast.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Desert Locusts</strong> offer a lot of maneuverability around things like S:P banish.</p>
            <p><strong>Hop Ear Squadron</strong> and <strong>Melffy Pinny</strong> are now both searched on the opening line, giving you options to get into Satellite from Vahram. Alternatively, you could use another body to get into Herald or Merry Melffys for more extensions.</p>
            <p><strong>Melffy Pony</strong> helps the grind game a lot. Early on adds a lot of impact with the Pinny recycle.</p>
            <p><strong>Hide and Seek</strong> now searched on first turn not only gives us destruction protection but also incredible follow up on recycle + draw 1.</p>
            <p><small>Beating top tier decks via Time Out is a very viable strategy with this list.</small></p>

            <h2>Staring Contest</h2>
            <time>Posted on: January 1, 2024</time>
            <p><strong>Rabby + Staring contest</strong> is a great 2 card package if you're seeing a ton of Tearlaments.</p>
            <p>Technically, you do not NEED Rabby, especially with the Pony inclusion.</p>
            <p>You can search Staring Contest off the turn 1 line instead of Hide and Seek and just wait to use Pinny effect until MP2.</p>
            <p>This does limit your line a bit without Rabby, though, who handles it all solo.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Extra Deck</h2>
            <p>ED space is so tight right now.</p>
            <p><strong>Hastorr</strong> actually goes insane against Rescue Ace and such but the niche opportunity has me defaulting to cards I expect to use more frequently.</p>
            <p>Mosquito is something I can't replace and the Synchros are obviously mandatory.</p>
            <p>rijit or Zeus or something but that really hurts our Kerass now that we don't even have Missus Radiant.</p>
            <p>You could replace Vahram with something that achieves a similar effect.</p>
            <p>Level 8 synchros that create some kind of board pressure are hyper consistent to get into.</p>
            <p>Level 12 Synchros can even be achieved regularly with the Pony inclusion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Tech Cards</h2>
            <p>The engine is so bulky in Pure Melffy that we are always strapped for tech space.</p>
            <p><strong>Evenly Matched</strong> is a must-have right now, in my opinion.</p>
            <p>If you don't like the Thrust package you can sub it out (3x Thrust, 1x Harpie's, 1x Triple Tac) but it does get extensions into Obedience.</p>
            <p>Droplet is really good, I swap it in when I go through sprees of not seeing Rescue Ace or other backline heavy decks.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, I use Thrust + Harpie's for the Rescue Ace counter.</p>
            <p>Pot of Avarice actually comes up a decent amount in the grind game but ultimately felt a little win more to me.</p>
            <p>Consider adding 1 for Thrust package?</p>
            <p>Idk Veiler / Imperm / Nibiru / Ghost Ogre / Skullmeister / etc etc - These can all be incorporated in the mentioned tech card slots or to replace your 'luxury starters'.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post">
            <h2>Luxury Starters</h2>
            <p>Currently my list has like an 85% chance of opening a 'starter' but that can be upped to 90%+ with the addition of 2~3 additional 'starters'.</p>
            <p>If you want to add these, you will have to drop some of your tech pressure (Thrust package, usually).</p>
            <p><strong>Deep Sea Diva</strong> is a 1 card Melffy of the Forest, S:P, or Mosquito.</p>
            <p>Treat it like a Nimble Beaver on your opening hand.</p>
            <p>Pot of Prosperity is a solid 1 card addition you can consider a starter.</p>
            <p>The ED banish is really tough, though.</p>
